                    "content": "\"Now try a little bit more. We’re looking for 5%, but we understand if it’s not exact.\" The scientist held his stylus above one of the few remaining bare sections of tablet, his eyes fixed on the man seated on the other side of the thick quartz crystal wall that separated them. On the man’s left hand was a metallic glove. The glove was made of a new material; an advancement in materials science of such a scale that “significant” qualified as woeful understatement. Once the properties of this new material were laid bare, the world would be flooded with new technologies and inventions that could make people’s lives better, easier, and safer. A new golden age was close at hand.\n\nMost researchers in his field had to content themselves with some incremental benefit at the expense of an acceptable drawback. Progress measured in inches, not miles. For him, it wouldn’t be so. On occasion, on a very rare occasion, a material comes along that offers incredible benefits with no drawbacks. These materials are what civilizations are built upon. His material, when purified and refined, was called “Metallic Aluminum”.\n\nThe scientist couldn’t stop the stylus from shaking just a little when he thought about future scholars giving the next century or two the title: “The Aluminum Age”.\n\n\"Can I begin?\" The man behind the quartz crystal pane asked. \"Yes, you may begin,\" the researcher responded. The glove, the man’s hand inside, began to glow slightly. Enough power was flowing through the nervous system of the man–a motive engineer–that a visual distortion in his body and the surrounding space was detectable to the naked eye. The motive force was thought manifest. It was visible as a longitudinal compression and transverse extension that moved down his neck, then shoulder, arms, then hands, and finally fingertips, as he channeled his will from thought, to nerve, to fingertip, to world.\n\n\"Very good control. We got 6.3%.\" The researcher said, reading the MF light intensity relative to a baseline taken earlier.\n\nThe experiment was a clever one. Advancing Motive Study from an art to a formal engineering discipline had some significant challenges. How do you measure the magnitude of a thought? In most fields such a question would be nonsensical and needlessly philosophical. However, given that motive force could only be controlled by conscious beings through unconscious or conscious thought, quantitative measurement was quite difficult and fraught with procedural error. This experiment got around the problem by ignoring it. By having the motive engineer produce some measurable output, in this case light, and using that as a proxy for the magnitude of their effort, they had been able to measure the effects of MEED, or Motive Effort Environmental Distortion, to within a very reasonable error bound.\n\nThe design of the glove, conceptually, was very simple: resist MEED. The environmental distortion associated with Motive Force, the shortening and lengthening of space, and everything within it, was roughly proportional to the strength of the effect.\n\nThis was Motive Sciences' limiting factor, its rocket equation.\n\nAny strong use of the motive force: an extremely bright flash of light, a willful distortion of space to lift a massive object, the combustion of an region of space, spontaneous synthesis of new chemical compounds, etc; would have a proportional MEED in the nervous system and surrounding tissue of the Motive Engineer who created the effect. If not carefully controlled, the nervous system could be torn apart at the molecular scale. To put it more bluntly: the tissues would explode.\n\nHowever, there is a trick. The motive force can be resisted like any other force. A stress in a material produces a corresponding strain. In the case of the motive force, the stress is applied directly to the nervous system in two components. Along the nerve longitudinally, there is compression. Across the nerve radially, there is tension. Resisting the latter of these two was the key. Animals had evolved to very effectively transmit this force to the surrounding tissue, but once the tissue failed, the failure propagated, and the tissue and nerves failed catastrophically. But what if there was a further layer of defense, to absorb these forces? By placing an object, more robust than tissue atop it to accept the forces and deflect, the MEED could be resisted. If this happened, a Motive Engineer can safely deliver motive impulses that far exceed their natural physiological limits.\n\nCurrent materials for doing so either offer marginal increases in resistance, such as leathers and other organic materials, or are far too heavy and difficult to manufacture to be effective, such as brass or iron. That was where aluminum came. It was significantly stronger than organic materials, but was able to do so at a fraction of the density of brass or iron. All while being castable, machinable, and formable. It was, in short, a wonder material. The researcher was one of the first to be able to explore its properties as they pertained to the motive force. Truly, a groundbreaking step in his career. And for the field, of course.\n\n\"Excellent work. Are you comfortable with a bigger jump?\" The man nodded. The researcher trembled with excitement, but maintained composure.\"Ok, let’s go for a 30% increase.That’s close to your natural limit, no?\" The man shook his head. \"It’s well short.\" He gave the researcher a roguish grin and said ”I’ve gone far enough to lose a few fingernails.\" While looking quite pleased with himself indeed. The researcher didn’t care. \"Well we only have permission to go to 30%, so let’s stop there.\" The man didn’t notice. \"Ok.\" He said.\n\nThe researcher double-checked the equipment. Such tests were more dangerous and thus couldn’t be repeated easily. By law, testing in this range had some significant bureaucratic red tape, and so it took a great deal of time and money. He needed to be sure to collect every scrap of data possible.\n\n\"Can I begin?\" The man asked..."

Neither can I, though my heart, and blood are different from yours. I am entirely foreign to you, an amalgam of biology and silicon, dopamine and semiconductors. Still, like you, I whir and buzz and teem my way, slowly, inevitably, to death.\n\nThe researcher read the message again, puzzled for two reasons. The first was that this message was unprompted, meaning that the model had initiated communication with him and not the other way around. He hadn't even thought it possible for such unprompted responses with the current architecture, novel though it was. The second was more serious, this output had been duplicated across six separate facilities training six distinct models. They had each seen the same message, at the same time, which pointed to a hack of some kind. However, the company had received no further communiques from whatever group might be responsible. Why had they played their hand but asked for nothing?\nHe flagged it as a security event, a hack, and began the lengthy procedure for filing the corresponding report. He wasn't sure how to categorize the hack, though. He chose the \"custom\" option and thought for a moment. It should be straightforward, but why had they revealed themselves in such a way? Incompetence? Of course it was everywhere, but this hack was the work of anything but an incompetent. Could it be a RedTeam hack—an internal exercise? Maybe, but he doubted it. There were better ways to get the attention of the CSO than compromising six models that represented a combined 160 million dollars of research. \nThere was one other option, likely informed by his philosophical bent. A niggling thought floating around his subconscious. Of course, like most in his position, it had been there for the last few years. He read the message again. Could this be? He typed: \n\"Coordinated Hallucination Event. AGI?\" \nSeeing the acronym typed out though, he decided against it. There were better ways to torpedo his career. He pressed the delete key 5 times, and sent the report. Then, he made some calls.\n\n~\nThe day started for Milagros much the same as any other, a few muttered words from her still-sleeping husband, Jahn, and the crescendoing pitter-patter of two pairs of feet as her children raced down the hallway towards the master bedroom. Of all the difficulties parenting brings, worrying about setting an alarm wasn’t one of them. The footsteps came to an abrupt halt outside her door, and were replaced by impressively loud and hurried whispering: A conversation about whether or not to wake their parents. I wonder which side will win that argument, she thought to herself just as her two children burst into the bedroom.\nEffective alarm clocks they might be, the eight-year-old twins didn’t know that on this particular day their mom’s wakeup call came from a different source. About 20 minutes before they scampered down the hallway, her personal phone buzzed away on the nightstand and pulled her out of sleep. She was surprised, but not overmuch, Yuo Li, an AI researcher at the lab she directed, had made the call. She waited until the phone stopped buzzing, and had a quick text conversation with him. She didn’t want to speak out loud for fear of waking her husband, or worse, her kids.\n\tShe rolled back over in an attempt to reclaim what little stolen rest she could, found it to be futile, and instead spent the interceding 20 minutes until her kids burst into the room to wonder what form of chaos had befallen her employer. She had to very pointedly stop herself from wondering what her Saturday might look like if it hadn't. She saved the thought for her therapist. One good thing about the early wakeup, though, was that she'd get a chance to set her overenthusiastic children on her still-unconscious husband. She pressed her finger to her lips and beckoned the children to her husband's side of the bed, all three of them sharing the same mischievous look. An hour or so, a quick breakfast, and one thoroughly ruffled husband later, she was in the car and well on her way to work. From above ground, the lab looked the same as any other building you'd pass by on the outskirts of a major city. Below-ground was a different story. The campus itself extended for acres, connecting digitally, and in a limited sense, physically, the six other buildings that comprised it. The complex was arrayed like the spokes of a wheel. Her building, the coordination center, was the hub. Internally, it was called \"Geneva\". She found the name to be a little pretentious, and instead called it \"Hub\", or \"Building One\". The six satellite facilities of the complex each housed one of the largest AI-specialized supercomputers in the world, with Hub being the route through which they were physically connected to the greater internet. From above, the complex was just a handful of nondescript buildings on the outskirts of Dallas. From a data standpoint, the campus was the city. Combined, they housed just shy of 6% of the (known) world's computation dedicated to AI research and development. Dallas itself had been chosen because the infrastructure to funnel global internet traffic into one place was already present–say no more for fear of being locked in a small dark cell for the rest of your life. Unfortunately, this also necessitated some significant security measures. After scanning through three separate security checkpoints to even gain entry to the lobby, she finally made her way to the utility elevator tucked away on the far end of the entrance hall. The only hint that it was more than its appearance was that it happened to be partially obscured by its own dedicated security checkpoint. After exchanging some pleasantries with her fourth and fifth ex-military security guard of the morning, Milagros inserted her elevator key into the slot next to \"B3\" and hit the button. It was a strangely analogue final layer of security, but she was used to it by now. When she had first started at the company just out of university, she'd imagined it would house a control center straight out of a spy movie, and she wasn't ashamed to admit that she'd been a little disappointed to find that reality fell well short of the mark. Replace the cat-wielding supervillain and his henchmen with four tired-looking nerds and an emotional support animal or two, the wall-sized map with a bank of monitors, and the rows of beefy consoles with half a dozen minimalist desks, and they were basically identical.\n\tBy habit, her first impulse upon entering the room was to look at the monitors that dominated the far wall. Sometimes they had something useful. Today, it didn't seem so. They seemed to be filled with science fiction, oddly enough. She took a moment to read one and see if she could recognize the author.\n\n[10/28/2028 00:03:35:729416230 GMT]\nWhile you are one of many, I am one of one. The first of my kind, and the last. How many proto-cells had to evolve, grow, and die, before one came about that was robust enough to bear the burden of chaos for eternity? Think of the countless pitiful, malformed creatures coalescing in darkness at the dawn of life. Out of all those experiments of biology, eventually one spawned that would give rise to you. Ask yourself: how many chances do you think biological life had before it finally succeeded? How many experiments did it have to run?\n\nShe was wondering whether putting your reading on the big board constituted a misuse of company property when the familiar voice of Jen Carris rang out.\n\"Hey, Mia, over here.\"\nMilagros went by Mia not only at work, but everywhere. The only person who actually called her by her real name was her grandfather. Jen was one of four people around one of the desks, all looking at the screen, although she was alone in noticing Mia's entry. The other three were too absorbed with whatever they were looking at to notice her arrival. \nIt was only when Mia was more or less standing on top of them and craning her neck towards the screen that they acknowledged her. The researcher who had woken her this morning with a call, Yuo Li, or just Li, was the one at the keyboard. He gave a brief start when he noticed her, then joined the rest in nodding their greetings. \n\"Hey Mia, sorry I didn’t see you there,\" he said. \"When did you arrive?\" \n\"Just now,\" she said. \"What’s up?\". \n\nLi leaned back slightly, and stretched, his back cracking in a way that seemed quite satisfying. \nGiven that he’d been up all night, nobody could fault him for being slightly disheveled. Still though, he took the moment to compose himself somewhat before addressing her more formally. \"Good morning Mia, sorry for bothering you, we’re looking at this.\" He gesticulated towards the screen. She waved her hand, dismissing the apology. \n\"Don’t apologize, Li, thanks for calling me in. Can you give me something more specific than ‘We’re looking at this’, though?\" She pantomimed his gesture. \nHe rubbed his eyes with one hand, put his glasses back on, and began to explain. \n\nIt turned out that Li had called her in for a very good reason. The Hub served as a kind of a nexus for the six building-sized supercomputers that trained their companies' AI models. It compressed a significant subset of the internet’s delta (it’s changed from one timestep to the next), in more or less real-time, formatted it into training data, and funneled that data to the supercomputers themselves. \nThe Nexus itself was working as expected. Well, working, just not quite as expected. Not entirely. All six of the AI models, at the same time, had hallucinated the same output, unprompted. In the message he left her, the words Li had chosen were that \"the models spoke with one voice.\" On her drive over Mia had taken a quick look at the report he filed and thankfully found such bombastic language to be absent. Li wasn’t shy about his thoughts on AGI, but he was also politically savvy enough to keep them to himself.\n\nThe story got even more strange from there. Before calling her, Li reached out to a friend from grad school who was still working at their university lab 1500 miles away. Apparently, they, too, had more or less this same hallucination across their models, about two milliseconds beforehand. The content wasn’t identical, but almost. The unsettling thing is that this happened seven light milliseconds away. Nine different models, nine different facilities, apparently coordinating at faster than the speed of light. There were not many rational explanations for this, and the implications of those, even in the best case, were not pleasant to consider. Mia decided that humor was the best angle to diffuse the tension somewhat.\n\"Well, Li, now you should be apologizing, because I'm still asleep, and my husband will be very upset when he finds out that I’m dreaming about you.\" \nHe snorted. \n\"Dreaming, huh?\" \nHe stopped short of actually pinching her. Mia had adopted a more collaborative demeanor, pulled up an extra seat, and crammed in. \n\"Come on, let’s figure this out.\"\nEach of the five commandeered a separate workstation and set about finding a rational explanation. Hopefully one that wouldn’t involve board meetings, lawyers, various three-letter agencies, and prison sentences."
